This is the toy app for Lesson 6 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/???).

## SleepQualityTracker

The SleepQualityTracker app is a demo app that helps you collect information about your sleep. 
* Start time
* End time

* Time slept

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:
* Room database

## How to use this repo while taking the course


Each code repository in this class has a chain of commits that looks like this:

![listofcommits](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/March/58befe2e_listofcommits/listofcommits.png)

These commits show every step you'll take to create the app. Each commit contains instructions for completing the that step.

Each commit also has a **branch** associated with it of the same name as the commit message, as seen below:

![branches](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/April/590390fe_branches-ud855/branches-ud855.png
)
Access all branches from this tab.

The branches are also accessible from the drop-down in the "Code" tab.
